<h3>Guidelines:</h3>
<p>
	We are so excited that you have shown an interest in R n R. There are few guidelines that we ask each 
	volunteer to follow: Please be aware that these trips can be extremely challenging - both emotionally and physically.  
	Keep this in mind if you have physical conditions such as heart or back problems, etc.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>We strongly advise everyone to stay up to date on all immunizations, especially  tetanus.</li>
	<li>Disaster relief is often a work in progress. Each volunteer is asked to come with a heart to serve 
		and an attitude of cooperation. We cannot guarantee that you will be used in your area of expertise; 
		however we will use you in some capacity. We must ask that you work within the framework and safety 
		protocol provided.</li>
	<li>We ask that students age 13-17 be accompanied by a parent or guardian. We do not accept volunteers under 
		age 13 because of the risks involved with disaster relief efforts and the sensitive, emotional nature of the 
		experience.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Code of  induct:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Each volunteer must be aware that our actions directly represent the Kingdom of God.</li>
	<li>All volunteers must agree to refrain from profanity and the use of alcohol or illegal drugs.</li>
	<li>You must agree to follow the instructions of those placed in leadership  and understand that 
		attitudes and actions must be guarded at all times.</li>
	<li>We reserve the right to decline or dismiss a volunteer at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	We believe that one trip will change your life. We are confident that once you participate, you will be 
	hooked. Disaster relief ministry has proven to be the most powerful missions trip some have ever experienced!
