<p>Welcome to the North Texas District Disaster Response and Relief
Network, or as we like to call it- R&amp;R. We, as God's people, are
instructed to 'know the season'- in other words- you know fall is here
when you start to see leaves turn brown and fall to the ground. In
this season of humanity, disasters are happening almost without any
break in between. We've decided that we want to be ready and waiting
to respond- rather than wait and react. Whether itï¿½s a flood, 
hurricane, tornado or wildfire, we want to hit the ground running
within the first week.</p> 
<p>Take a moment to look around our site. Look at the 'Info' on our
trips. Click the 'Volunteer' button to be one of the volunteers, not
only for a current trip- but to be notified for future trips. Register
your 'Resources' to be used on a trip, or even donated. Or simply
'Contact' us and we will respond within twenty-four hours. It is our
honor to represent the King by serving the people He loves.</p>
